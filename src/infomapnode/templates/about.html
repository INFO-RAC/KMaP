        InfoMAPNode is the geoportal for viewing and consulting metadata and geospatial data collected under the Barcelona
        Convention. The platform allows you to consult data directly collected by UNEP/MAP and theis MAP components or data
        collections that are produced by international bodies and/or projects, operating in the context of the Mediterranean
        Sea.

        InfoMAPNode is based on the open software package of GeoNode that is a geospatial content management system, using
        as platform for the management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and stable open-source
        software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and
        create interactive maps.

        Data management tools built into InfoMAPNode allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map
        visualizations. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific
        users, following INFO/RAC Data Management policy (please visit INFO/RAC website for more information). Social
        features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each
        platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the geoportal instance contains.

        It is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend, modify or integrate against to
        meet requirements in their own applications.
